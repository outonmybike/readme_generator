## Installation

To install, clone the Git repo to the desired instance. Ensure the local environment has Node as well as other dependencies already installed

## Usage

To use the generator run the index.js file with Node in the local command line. After providing responses to the command line prompts, a README.md file will be generated and stored in the dist/ folder of the Git repo. 

A sample README.md file generated using the program is currently stored in the dist/ folder of the Git repo. The sample file will be over written once the index.js file is successfuly run.
